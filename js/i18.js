					title: 'Frequently Asked Questions',
					q01: "What is Voicecoin?",
					a01: "Voicecoin is the cryptocurrency used on the Voicecoin platform and is also the first phase of the Voiceweb project.",
					q02: "What is Voiceweb?",
					a02: "Chatbots are registered on the Voice Chain. People then use the Voice Name to access a Chatbot by voice and use the various services provided by the Chatbot. Because each Chatbot has an exclusive and unique ID, Chatbots can also reference and connect with each other, and in this way an interconnected chatbot network is formed. From the perspective of voice, we have named this web the Voice Web.",
					q03: "What is the Voice Domain?",
					a03: "Instead of using the keyboard to enter a traditional domain name, our voice Internet browser, the Voice Browser, uses voice to access. These domain names, unlike traditional domain names, are in the form of natural language that we call the Voice Domain. When people use a voice Internet device, they access the desired services by calling up the appropriate Voice Domain.",
					q04: "What will the communication protocol of the Voice Browser be?",
					a04: "For better network conditions, HTTP / HTTPS is recommended. For poor network conditions, the MQTT protocol can be used, and Headload for smaller protocols. At present, the CoAP protocol is also the more commonly used protocol in IoT. For small devices, implementing the TCP and HTTP protocols is clearly excessive. The CoAP protocol was designed to allow small devices to connect to the Internet. CoAP is an application layer protocol that runs on the UDP protocol rather than TCP over HTTP. CoAP protocol is very small, the smallest data packet is only 4 bytes.",
					q05: "Won't people prefer to install such a capability themselves and then use it?",
					a05: "The trouble with this approach is that getting to the use phase can be troublesome because you first must install and set-up the capability. Imagine you are traveling while wearing such a device; your set up will be very troublesome. We will also provide a favorites function for ease of use.",
					q06: "What is DBot?",
					a06: "Voiceweb is one of our means of achieving this new form of internet, that will be built using blockchain technology. In Voiceweb, the sites will no longer take the form of the traditional web, but will serve mainly in the form of voice conversations, known as DBots.",
					q07: "Why not solve these issues using traditional domain names?",
					a07: "The main issue is that the traditional domain name design is not suited to the characteristics of voice, but really only suitable to keyboard input. People have witnessed the inconvenience of entering these domains when surfing the Internet, and they are extremely inconvenient when using a speaker interface. Many domain names do not pass the Radio Test. Voice Blockchain aims to establish standards so that registered domain names take a natural language form, without special symbols, that can be easily read and are identifiable by voice. The Namecoin platform utilizes this this scheme of establishing a domain name through the blockchain, but the Namecoin platform has no voice domain name resolution.",
					q08: "Why not use the Ethereum of NEO blockchain platform to address these issues?",
					a08: "Any developer can create a domain name smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain platform, but the problem is voice domain names are industry-specific; Chatbot developers uniformly follow this standard and then push their products to the specialized organizations, with nothing more than a hope that they’ll become a public industry resource. Owing to the special nature of Chatbots, including the communication protocol, security certification, user privacy, and other issues, there are many special requirements associated with the provision of a voice domain name blockchain that can only be solved through a proprietary platform.",
					q09: "Why create this project?",
					a09: "The earliest motivation for the Voiceweb project was to find a method of revitalizing the Web in the Internet of Things Era, using Blockchain technology. In the Mobile Era, people are using social platforms more and more, and utilizing the Web less. But these social platforms are centralized and not globally open or interconnected. In this Internet of Things Era, the founders believe that people are more likely to access the Internet via voice. But if a new open standard is not developed, this new Internet access point will be controlled solely by the Internet Giants, which would result in all online services needing to be distributed through a centralized voice platform. The founders are dissatisfied with the bleak outlook of a centralized future, and instead adopt a decentralized view aimed at smashing the monopolies these large companies are establishing, and bringing about the birth of a new open voice Internet Era.",
					q10: "How do you establish an individual Voice Web ecosystem?",
					a10: "In the initial Voiceweb’s ecology, we will develop voice application plug-ins on Alexa or Google Home, and these voice plugins will resolve various chatbot service brands. As the marketplace continues to validate this model, a voice-based chatbot browser will eventually be introduced. This browser will be the essential software for voice speakers. The browser access agreement will be open so that more people will develop this kind of browser.",

Through the community, third-party developers and technological innovations, we will create an open-source globally influential ecology that will integrate voice domain names into domain name services of all walks of life, in order to improve people’s online experience. Through the integration of regulatory logic, and through linking with third-party platforms, we will establish the voice Internet.",

					moti: {
						h1: "Motivation",
						p1: "Since the invention of the World Wide Web, it has been widely loved by the public for its open nature. But we have noticed that the Web is not perfect, and its abuses are continuously emerging. 1. In the mobile Internet Era, World Wide Web usage is falling far below that of mobile APPs. ​2. Within social networks, the Web is becoming more and more entangled and entwined with these centralized platforms, becoming little more than an accessory not available to the general public. 3. As stated by Tim Berners Lee, the father of the World Wide Web, the prevalence of rumors and loss of control over personal data are severe challenges to the Web. 4. In the IoT era, people cannot type URLs and browse web pages on a smart voice device that lacks a user interface. If voice is to be the main way people use web services in the future, then entering web addresses into the World Wide Web will be history. 5. Amid the fierce competition of among Internet giants, centralized forces are trying to establish a monopoly over Internet access. The World Wide Web is being split into independent kingdoms by them to track user behavior and covertly sell this data to gain advertising revenue. The result is the inadequate protection of people’s data and privacy, as well as added difficulties for developers and greater inconveniences to those people using the service.",
						p2: "Artificial intelligence and blockchain technology are constantly creating new conditions that allow people to enjoy a better Internet life. We believe that the World Wide Web can only avoid annihilation by the torrent of technological development in the world through highly advanced development. We cannot rely on the W3C to do this. We have endured an endless era of WAP, which is ample proof of the serious lag in the development of the World Wide Web. We propose building a Voiceweb that combines voice and semantics based upon blockchain technology, building on the three foundational achievements of John Berners Lee, and we are have already established and are in the process of improving the Voiceweb protocol stack. Voice is the most fundamental means of communication between people and should also be the main way for people to communicate with other kinds of intelligence. The trend of smart terminals brought about by cloud integration requires a more powerful human-computer interaction than the touch screen of a mobile phone. With this goal and purpose, we must first establish a decentralized voice domain name system to link with decentralized artificial intelligence services.",

The tenet of foundation management is that the foundation’s product designs and management policies must conform to these objectives and they must also be included in the implementation phase. The Foundation’s values are partly inherited from ICANN, the WWW organization, and the Bitcoin Foundation. Any decision that violates these core values must be immediately terminated and corrected. Full support and promotion of this value system is needed for sustainable development. ",
						p2: "ICANN’s goal: One world, One Internet. On this basis, Voice Blockchain analysis is aimed only at voice domain name services, and strives to take the lead amid fierce market competition, gradually forming an industry standard that is accepted by the majority of intelligent speaker equipment manufacturers, thus benefiting more Internet users. The ideologies inherited from the WWW include open-source and inter connectivity. The Voiceweb Blockchain project’s founding tenet is to revitalize the WEB in the era of voice Internet access to avoid complete monopolization by the Internet giants. ​",

					q01: "What is Voicecoin?",
					a01: "Voicecoin is the cryptocurrency used on the Voicecoin platform and is also the first phase of the Voiceweb project.",
					q02: "What is Voiceweb?",
					a02: "Chatbots are registered on the Voice Chain. People then use the Voice Name to access a Chatbot by voice and use the various services provided by the Chatbot. Because each Chatbot has an exclusive and unique ID, Chatbots can also reference and connect with each other, and in this way an interconnected chatbot network is formed. From the perspective of voice, we have named this web the Voice Web.",
					q03: "What is the Voice Domain?",
					a03: "Instead of using the keyboard to enter a traditional domain name, our voice Internet browser, the Voice Browser, uses voice to access. These domain names, unlike traditional domain names, are in the form of natural language that we call the Voice Domain. When people use a voice Internet device, they access the desired services by calling up the appropriate Voice Domain.",
					q04: "What will the communication protocol of the Voice Browser be?",
					a04: "For better network conditions, HTTP / HTTPS is recommended. For poor network conditions, the MQTT protocol can be used, and Headload for smaller protocols. At present, the CoAP protocol is also the more commonly used protocol in IoT. For small devices, implementing the TCP and HTTP protocols is clearly excessive. The CoAP protocol was designed to allow small devices to connect to the Internet. CoAP is an application layer protocol that runs on the UDP protocol rather than TCP over HTTP. CoAP protocol is very small, the smallest data packet is only 4 bytes.",
					q05: "Won't people prefer to install such a capability themselves and then use it?",
					a05: "The trouble with this approach is that getting to the use phase can be troublesome because you first must install and set-up the capability. Imagine you are traveling while wearing such a device; your set up will be very troublesome. We will also provide a favorites function for ease of use.",
					q06: "What is DBot?",
					a06: "Voiceweb is one of our means of achieving this new form of internet, that will be built using blockchain technology. In Voiceweb, the sites will no longer take the form of the traditional web, but will serve mainly in the form of voice conversations, known as DBots.",
					q07: "Why not solve these issues using traditional domain names?",
					a07: "The main issue is that the traditional domain name design is not suited to the characteristics of voice, but really only suitable to keyboard input. People have witnessed the inconvenience of entering these domains when surfing the Internet, and they are extremely inconvenient when using a speaker interface. Many domain names do not pass the Radio Test. Voice Blockchain aims to establish standards so that registered domain names take a natural language form, without special symbols, that can be easily read and are identifiable by voice. The Namecoin platform utilizes this this scheme of establishing a domain name through the blockchain, but the Namecoin platform has no voice domain name resolution.",
					q08: "Why not use the Ethereum of NEO blockchain platform to address these issues?",
					a08: "Any developer can create a domain name smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain platform, but the problem is voice domain names are industry-specific; Chatbot developers uniformly follow this standard and then push their products to the specialized organizations, with nothing more than a hope that they’ll become a public industry resource. Owing to the special nature of Chatbots, including the communication protocol, security certification, user privacy, and other issues, there are many special requirements associated with the provision of a voice domain name blockchain that can only be solved through a proprietary platform.",
					q09: "Why create this project?",
					a09: "The earliest motivation for the Voiceweb project was to find a method of revitalizing the Web in the Internet of Things Era, using Blockchain technology. In the Mobile Era, people are using social platforms more and more, and utilizing the Web less. But these social platforms are centralized and not globally open or interconnected. In this Internet of Things Era, the founders believe that people are more likely to access the Internet via voice. But if a new open standard is not developed, this new Internet access point will be controlled solely by the Internet Giants, which would result in all online services needing to be distributed through a centralized voice platform. The founders are dissatisfied with the bleak outlook of a centralized future, and instead adopt a decentralized view aimed at smashing the monopolies these large companies are establishing, and bringing about the birth of a new open voice Internet Era.",
					q10: "How do you establish an individual Voice Web ecosystem?",
					a10: "In the initial Voiceweb’s ecology, we will develop voice application plug-ins on Alexa or Google Home, and these voice plugins will resolve various chatbot service brands. As the marketplace continues to validate this model, a voice-based chatbot browser will eventually be introduced. This browser will be the essential software for voice speakers. The browser access agreement will be open so that more people will develop this kind of browser.",

						h1: "初衷",
						p1: "万维网被发明以来，由于它的开放性和传播性的广泛深深受到了人们的喜爱。然而，任何事物都是不完美的，万维网也不例外。它的弊端正在一一显现: 1、万维网在移动互联网时代的使用率，远远低于移动 APP 的使用率; 2、在社交网络中，Web 更多地被中心化的社交平台携裹，成为一种不能被全球网民浏览的附属物;3、正如万维网之父 Tim Berners Lee 所述，Web 面临谣言的盛行、人们正失去对数据的控制并面临着诸多严峻的挑战; 4、在 IoT 时代，人们无法对着一个无界面的智能语音设备输入网址、浏览网页，如果说未来人们使用网络服务的主要方式是这样的，那么输入网址访问万维网的方式将会成为历史; 5、在互联网巨头的竞争中，各个中心化的势力都在试图建立互联网流量入口上的垄断，万维网被它们分裂成为一个个独立的王国，跟踪用户行为、 变相出卖用户数据牟取广告收入，使人们的数据安全和隐私得不到真正、有效的保护，同时也给开发者带来了开发阻碍和并给他们带来了使用上的诸多不便。",
						p2: "人工智能和区块链技术，正在不断地创造崭新的条件和空间，让人们可以体验更加美好的互联网生活。我们认为，万维网应具有更加超前的先发优势，才能不被世界科技发展的洪流所湮灭。我们不能依赖 W3C 来做这件事，我们曾经经历过非常漫长的 WAP 时代，这就是万维网发展严重滞后的充分证明。 我们首当其冲提出了：建立语音万维网 Voiceweb。结合语音和语义，基于区块链技术， 从 John Berners Lee 发明的三项基本成果出发来构建语音万维网，已经制定并正在不断改进和完善语音万维网的协议栈。语音是人与人之间最主要、最直接的沟通方式，也应该是人与另一种智能进行交流的主要方式。云端一体化带来的趋势是高度智能化，智能终端需要一个比手机触屏更强大的人机交互方式。基于这个目标和宗旨，我们首先建立了起去中心化的语音域名体系，以对接去中心化的人工智能服务。"
